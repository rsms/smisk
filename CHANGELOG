Changes
=======

1.1.1
-----

* Fully unicode on the inside -- request.get, .post, .cookies, etc return
  unicode values and where dictionary keys are used, which have been translated
  from the outside world, they are guranteeded to be encoded as UTF-8.
  (Dictionary keys used as keyword arguments must be str in Python <=2.5)

* YAML read/write-serialization #21 [a72dc2f0855b]

* Handles and reconnects dead MySQL-connections. #23 [49cb2034a8b1]

* No longer stores empty parts as None from multipart messages. #15
  [d9920fb75ca2]

* Makes full use of HTTP 1.1 request methods (OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, PUT, POST,
  DELETE).

* smisk.mvc.model no longer disposes SA/Elixir sessions for each request, but
  tries to reuse a session as long as no error occur.

* redirect_to() respects and retains explicit request format, denoted by path
  extension in the original request.

* smisk.test.live introduces "live" tests, running a server and a client,
  measuring communication and effects.
