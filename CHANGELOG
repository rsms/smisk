Changes
=======

1.1.2
-----

* Inter-process communication module smisk.ipc, providing a shared dictionary
  which can be concurrently manipulated by a set of processes.

* Berkely DB module smisk.core.bsddb

* Benchmark utility module smisk.util.benchmark exposes an iterator which can
  be used to easily benchmark snippets of code.
  
* The key-value store example application now uses the shared dictionary
  provided by smisk.ipc.

* smisk.util.cache has a new function – app_shared_key – returning a byte
  string which can be used to uniqely identify the application. The key is
  based on the entry file (the python file in which __name__ == "__main__").

* smisk.util.type exposes MutableMapping – in Python >=2.6 this is 
  collections.MutableMapping, in Python >=2.3 it is UserDict.DictMixin.

* Serializers no longer emit warning.warn-messages when no suiting
  implementations are available. Now they are simply not registered whitout as
  much as a whisper.

* In the C library, the macro SMISK_PyString_Check has changed name to 
  SMISK_STRING_CHECK (however it still does the exact same thing as before,
  just that in preparation for porting Smisk to Python 3, we need to sort out
  the different meanings of "bytes strings" and "character strings")

* In the C library, we use PyBytes instead of PyString and NUMBER_* instead of
  some PyInt-functions, having macros for Python <2.5. This is a step toward
  the Python 3 port.

* smisk.core is now stored as _smisk and imported by smisk/core/__init__.py.
  This follows the naming custom of other machine-native modules as well as
  provides better name (i.e. _smisk.so instead of core.so) in various listings.


1.1.1
-----

* Fully unicode on the inside -- request.get, .post, .cookies, etc return
  unicode values and where dictionary keys are used, which have been translated
  from the outside world, they are guranteeded to be encoded as UTF-8.
  (Dictionary keys used as keyword arguments must be str in Python <=2.5)

* YAML read/write-serialization #21 [a72dc2f0855b]

* Handles and reconnects dead MySQL-connections. #23 [49cb2034a8b1]

* No longer stores empty parts as None from multipart messages. #15
  [d9920fb75ca2]

* Makes full use of HTTP 1.1 request methods (OPTIONS, GET, HEAD, PUT, POST,
  DELETE). See example application: examples/mvc/key-value-store/

* smisk.mvc.model no longer disposes SA/Elixir sessions for each request, but
  tries to reuse a session as long as no error occur.

* redirect_to() respects and retains explicit request format, denoted by path
  extension in the original request.

* smisk.test.live introduces "live" tests, running a server and a client,
  measuring communication and effects.


1.1.0
-----

* MVC module – smisk.mvc.

* Better unicode support.

* Compatible with Debian Etch.

* Host server URL rewrites now propagating correctly.


1.0.1
-----

* Full WSGI support – passes the wsgiref validation tests.

* Iterable request makes reading input data simple.

* Stream implements writelines for optimized sending of chunks of strings.

* Response implements a Stream.writelines proxy, automatically calling
  begin().

* Callable response makes responses simpler. Based on writelines.

* Fixed a bug where smisk_multipart_parse_file would try to fclose a
  uninitialized fd. [11c4ffae718f]


1.0.0
-----

* First stable version
